# WCAG interpretation
## These (still) aren't the SCs you're looking for...

WCAG is supposed to give us a reasonably objective way of saying whether or not the sites we are building/auditing are "accessible" (to a particular baseline). However, they are only as useful as our understanding and interpretation of the actual guidelines' normative text. And of course they're not perfect - with some omissions, handwaving, and straight up loopholes. So where does this leave developers and auditors? In this talk, Patrick may not have all the answers, but he'll have a good rant around the subject anyway...

## Repository structure

* `gh-pages` contains the latest/most complete version of this presentation – a big brain-dump of all things relating to WCAG interpretation, current gaps and loopholes
* individual workshops/conference talks which use a shortened or adapted version of these slides live in their own separate branches – these are usually left dangling/unmerged
